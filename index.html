                <h3><span>New Partnerships</span></h3>
                <p>More than ever, a healthy music ecosystem in 2024 requires responsible sharing of data and information. In an effort to to gather more direct and accurate reporting and provide a clearer picture of the industry, the RIAA has partnered with indie labels to integrate their revenue data into the RIAA reporting process.</p>

            <h3><span>Recorded Music in the US</span></h3>
            <p>Recorded music is just one part of a broader landscape that holds vast economic significance, with live performances, artist rights, and emerging technologies all playing crucial roles. In 2024, this wider ecosystem has been especially active. Powered by stadium tours, ticket sales have soared as live music roars back after pandemic shutdowns. Legislation is also evolving, with Tennessee Governor Bill Lee signing the Ensuring Likeness Voice and Image Security (ELVIS) Act to protect artists from AI misuse. Meanwhile, global music revenues keep rising, Record Store Day saw another successful year, and Latin music continued its growth in the U.S. Altogether, 2024 has proven to be a dynamic and pivotal year for music.</p>

            <h3><span>Growth Drivers</span></h3>
            <p>Over the past 9 years the music industry has added more than $11 Billion in value. During this period, the value of paid subscriptions has grown by $10.6 Billion - nearly matching the entire net value added to the industry. The renaisannce of Vinyl Albums has also played a vital role for the recovery of the recorded music industry and paid subscriptions and vinyl albums contributed 87 cents to every new dollar added to the industry in 2024. Despite the divergent characteristics of these formats, they have become bedrocks for music consumption and give fans the ability to support their favorite artists while enjoying all of the music they love anytime and anywhere they listen.</p>

            <div class="report-column">
                <p>The value of recorded music has grown in the US thanks to more Americans paying for music subscriptions each year. While the pace of new accounts and users has slowed from the early adoption stage - millions of subscriptions continue to be added each year. The RIAA estimates that 1 in 3 Americans subscribe to a music service with 130 million users across 100 million accounts in the US.</p>

            <h3><span>The Importance of Vinyl</span></h3>
            <p>Vinyl albums have been sold every year that the RIAA has tracked revenue data - all the way back to 1973. In 2024 the LP has become integral to the way labels and artists plan an album release, giving fans a way to connect with and show support to their favorite artists. The value of vinyl albums sold in the US has been increasing for 19 straight year, dating back to 2005. A format that once was considered a relic, vinyl is now worth more than $1B and contributes nearly 8% of total revenue. This value is on par with the immense amount of streaming that happens on free services.</p>

            <h2 class="heading">PROTECT MUSIC</h2>
            <h3><span>A Worthy Cause</span></h3>
            <p>Streaming has provided a lifeline for recoded music over the last decade. Fans can now access music in more ways than ever before and the rapid declines of the early 2000s have been replaced with growth and innoviation. Amidst rapid technological advancements ushering in a new era of growth, the music industry remains focused on protecting and amplifying the creative and commercial value of music. The sector is at a critical inflection point, with the rise of generative AI and short-form platforms presenting both opportunities and challenges. Music continues to drive cultural moments across technology, gaming, film, and more, while demand for high-quality content from world-class artists remains strong. Despite this growth, the fight to ensure music’s true value is recognized continues. As the industry expands and becomes more complex, global reach and expertise are critical in helping artists build long-lasting careers, cultivate dedicated fan bases, and stand out amidst increasing noise. Whether independent or major, record labels offer more than just services; they provide the passion and support needed to help artists realize their dreams, express themselves, and reach audiences worldwide. Together, the industry is pioneering a future where music’s value is upheld, creators are prioritized, and art flourishes. </p>
